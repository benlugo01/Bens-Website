        <div class="subheading mb-5">MarketingðŸ“š</div
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Benjamin Lugo, an undergraduate first year Hispanic student at University of California Riverside. During my time at University of California Riverside, I am currently studying Pre-Business and hopefully achieving my goal of getting into UC Riverside's school of business and have a concentration in marketing. What intrigued me to get into business was the fact that I love all things about creating a business and being a part of the whole production line of what keeps a business going. I hope with my marketing degree that I obtain a good job in marketing or social media management in the gaming industry and gain connections within my time at UCR. Within the gaming community I hope to gain connections with big corporations such as Riot games or even MSI. Throughout my life Iâ€™ve always been gravitated with gaming and all things that go behind making a product of a certain game come to life. So, being able to get a marketing degree and focus on finding a job within the gaming community is one of my main priorities as of right now. 
<br><br>

        A bit more about me is that I am a student with parents who came from Mexico to the US in hopes of finding a better life and to give her future children an outstanding life. They have struggled through many obstacles to achieve this in which they have faced problems with obtaining jobs while barely understanding a new language. They have also faced the obstacles of going into a new country with no support as most of their families are not from the US. However, this hasn't them from achieving their main goal, which is to obtain a better life in America. With this new life, they hope to bring it to me and siblings as well and because of this I strive to accomplish my education and obtain my undergraduate bachelorâ€™s to uphold their struggles of coming to the US. 
  <br><br>

        While I only have a few months of experience at University of California Riverside I hope to strive to be at this current university and make the best out of it. This comes with keeping up with my grades and focusing a critical part of my time with studying and having my homework turned in on time. I am a student who gives their all with their education, even though there are obstacles that come with this, I still strive to obtain my degree. To obtain my degree means obtaining a good job to support my parents and family members for all the struggles they had to face to give me a better life.
